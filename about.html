				<p>I am fascinated with how the subconscious manifests itself through our hands. My goal is to consciously <br>sculpt the world I live in, to tell stories of healing and transcendence. I create narratives of
        <br>characters with both human and fantastical qualities which have relatable experiences and provide <br>examples of different ways we can heal and practice taking care of ourselves and each other. I want to<br> explore symbols and archetypes, and how humans use these to generate myths and direct our narratives. <br>
Human relationships—with ourselves, friends, families, lovers, and communities—are also a central theme for me. <br>My work examines the effects we have on each other and the environment, and the healing that can occur when we <br>accept the paradoxes within our own identities and those around us.<br><br>
Hardly anything keeps me as grounded or makes me feel as alive as working in three-dimensional mediums does. <br>I think through my hands.  It is crucial for me to have this movement and physical contact with the world to <br>avoid becoming lost in abstractions. I love textures and anything that connects me to reality through my <br>senses. Kneading wet clay makes me think about the earth, and all the information we have from past cultures <br>because of the durability of ceramics. ­­I consider myself an instrument with a microcosmic lens for telling <br>the macrocosmic story of the human experience.<br><br>
In addition to tactile interaction with my environment, another crucial aspect of my creative process is <br>interacting with people. I think a lot about how we use those around us as mirrors, sometimes in search of the <br>truth, and sometimes seeking flattery. Another important aspect of my creative process  for tactile interaction is <br>the joy of sharing my work with others, and the connections that sharing facilitates.<br><br>
I am interested in how the human hands are unique in distinguishing humans from most other mammals, how they <br>correlate with our brains, and how ­­we use them to build our reality. Hands are points of transmission between the <br>mind and the tangible world. Hands symbolize free will—they have the power to both create and destroy. Because<br> of human hands, we have art and culture. They help us communicate. We gain information through sensory input, <br>through touch.<br><br>
Hands also symbolize power and control. I have found that my creative process, however, requires that I relinquish<br> a particular need for control in order for my feelings, thoughts, and ideas to be fully realized in <br>three-dimensional form. As I evolve as an artist, I hope to build a sustainable creative practice that allows me <br>to create stories of healing, transformation, and personal and collective power.</p>
